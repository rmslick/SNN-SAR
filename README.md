# Spiking Neural Network for SAR data

SNN designed with SpykeTorch for classifying Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery data. SNN is a reinforcement using network that uses STDP based learning and lateral inhibition to train a network of neurons.

## Usage

Running the following will train the network on the MSTAR Synthetic Aperture Radar dataset. It uses the SN_9563 and SN_C71 vehicles.

```bash
python MStar.py
```
